         <p>I am a graduate student at the University of Central Florida studying Statistical Computing with a focus in statistical theory. I work for the Statistics department as a department assistant.</p>
         <p>
I am an active member of Calvary Baptist Church in Winter Garden, Fl and enjoy engaging in different church outreaches like volleyball and basketball outreach and our fall festival every November. I also work with the Sound department and sing in the choir.          </p> 
         <p>
When Iâ€™m not in school, I enjoy playing volleyball, biking, or just chatting/hanging out with friends as well as traveling in the summertime.         </p>
